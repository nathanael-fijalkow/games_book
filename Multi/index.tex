\subsubsection*{Multiplayer games}

We use $k$ as the number of players. 
By convention, indexing over $i$ should be understood as $i$ ranging over all players.
For instance, we use a colour set $C_i$ for each player, and let $C = \prod_i C_i$ be the set of colours.

\begin{definition}
A multiplayer arena $\arena$ with $k$ players is a tuple $(G,\Delta)$ where $G = (V,E)$ is a graph
and $\Delta : V \times A^k \to E$.
\end{definition}
