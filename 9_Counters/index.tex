\section{Resource-Conscious Games}
\label{12-resource}
"Vector games" are very well suited for reasoning about systems
manipulating discrete resources, modelled as counters.  However, in
the "natural semantics", actions that would deplete some resource,
i.e., that would make some counter go negative, are simply inhibited.
In models of real-world systems monitoring resources like a gas
tank or a battery, a depleted resource would be considered as a system
failure.  In the "energy games" of \cref{12-energy}, those situations
are accordingly considered as winning for \Adam.  Moreover, if we are
modelling systems with a bounded capacity for storing resources, a
counter exceeding some bound might also be considered as a failure,
which will be considered with "bounding games" in \cref{12-bounding}.

These resource-conscious games can be seen as providing alternative
semantics for "vector systems".  They will also be instrumental in
establishing complexity upper bounds for "monotonic" "asymmetric vector
games" later in \cref{12-complexity}, and are strongly related to
"multidimensional" "mean-payoff" games, as will be explained in
\cref{13-sec:MPEG} of \cref{chap:multiobjective}.

\section{The Complexity of Asymmetric Monotone Games}
\label{12-complexity}

Unlike general "vector games" and "configuration reachability"
"asymmetric" ones, "coverability", "non-termination", and
"parity@parity vector game" "asymmetric vector games" are decidable.
We survey in this section the best known complexity bounds for every
case; see \cref{12-tbl-cmplx} at the end of the chapter for a summary.

\subsection{Upper Bounds}
\label{12-sub-up}
We begin with complexity upper bounds.  The main results are that
"parity@parity vector game" games with "existential initial credit"
can be solved in \coNP, but are in \kEXP[2] with "given initial
credit".  In both cases however, the complexity is pseudo-polynomial
if both the dimension~$\dd$ and the number of priorities~$d$ are
fixed, which is rather good news: one can hope that, in practice, both
the number of different resources (encoded by the counters) and the
complexity of the functional specification (encoded by the parity
condition) are tiny compared to the size of the system.

\subsection{Lower Bounds}
\label{12-sub-low}
Let us turn our attention to complexity lower bounds for "monotonic"
"asymmetric vector games".  It turns out that most of the upper bounds
shown in \cref{12-sub-up} are tight.
