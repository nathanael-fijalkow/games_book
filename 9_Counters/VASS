Two techniques:
- Brazdil Jancar Kucera (used the technique): induction on the
  dimension of the VASS. Adapt the Rackoff technique to games 
- geometric technique: perfect half-space techniques initially Yaron
  Velner and Krish for multi-dimensional MP

Questions:

Relative importance of the `infinite arena' vs. `multidimensional
energy'?

Relative importance of `Rackoff technique' (solves state reachability
in VASS games, but only yields a TOWER upper bound for parity)
vs. `perfect half-space' (gives optimal 2EXP for parity, but really
technical)
