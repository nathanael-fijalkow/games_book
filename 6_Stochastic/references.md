A good reference for this proof is Kucera (chapter on stochastic
  games). Many papers reference Condon 92, but her proof less elegant,
  and from the beginning there is a restriction to MD
  strategies... The memoryless determinacy also holds for stochastic
  parity games (see CHJ-soda04). Check whether it is a byproduct of
  reductions.
