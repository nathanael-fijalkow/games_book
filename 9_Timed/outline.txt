OUTLINE

* TECHNICAL CONTENT
** Modeling Real-Time Systems
Motivating Example (Train-Gate?)
** Timed games
(Uppaal timed games)
** State-Space Exploration with Zones
Basics of operations with DBMs with some proofs
Federations, why we need them (complement, union etc)
Not all details can be given
** Algorithms
*** Backward fixpoint algorithm
Easy to describe once federations are defined
We can refer to algorithms for finite games in earlier chapters
Short proof of correctness using stated properties of zones
*** Forward Algorithm
** Weighted timed games (1 page)
Decidability/undecidability
** Overview of Other Results
*** Concurrent Semantics with Surprise (1 page)
*** Abstraction-Refinement Algorithm - Synthia
*** Robust games ?
*** Partial-information by Franck Cassez (FORMATS'07) ?
