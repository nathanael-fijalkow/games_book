I will first introduce concurrent games (unless it has been done in an earlier chapter).

I intend to split the chapter into three sections:
\begin{enumerate}
\item discounted games (mentioning similar results for ergodic mean-payoff games)
\item reachability games
\item mean-payoff games (mentioning similar results for parity games)
\end{enumerate}



After the introduction, but before the sections, I want to proof things that are true for any of these classes of stochastic games, namely that strategies requires randomness in general and that typically approximation is used, because the values (and optimal strategies) can be irrational (in particular algebraic) numbers. 

In section 1 I will show that values and strategies for discounted games can be approximated in non-deterministic polynomial time. The proof also implies that strategy and value iteration runs in at most exponential time on such games (similar for ergodic mean-payoff games).

In section 2 I will argue that optimal strategies need not exists for reachability games and also
epsilon-optimal strategies for reachability games, for fixed epsilon, requires exponentially many bits and thus naively guessing the strategy requires non-deterministic exponential time. I will also show how to find states from which the goal state can be reached with probability 1 (or 0). I will also show that decision problem for the value and strategies can be done in PSPACE, using existential first order theory over the reals.
Space permitting I will also argue that the strategy and value iteration algorithm takes double exponential time.

In section 3 I will argue that no finite memory and no Markov strategies need to be $\epsilon$-optimal for small $\epsilon>0$. Also, I will argue that decision problem for the value is in EXPTIME using first order theory over the reals (or in polynomial time for a fixed number of states).
Space permitting I will also argue how to create strategies that uses $\log \log T$ space for the first $T$ rounds (classic strategies uses $\log T$ space for the first $T$ rounds).
