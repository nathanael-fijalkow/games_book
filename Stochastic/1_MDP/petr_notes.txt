Is the following used somewhere:

probability operator applied to a play (returning prob of the corresponding cylinder)
surely winning strategy

edges indexed from 0

Payoff has the aggregator as a subscript, unless known from the context


knowledge typical syntax: 
\knowledge{expectation}[expected value]{notion,index={expected value}}

During edits I removed the operator OPAS and added the safety operator! Might be important in latter sections.

Enabled actions: where could be remove and how

\label{5-thm:as-complexity} - could get rid of by introducing sink

5-thm:general-mp-main - the same
